pystif
======

Collection of utilities to compute projections of high-dimensional
polyhedra into lower dimensional subspaces. In particular, this software
focusses on linear cones as generated by Shannon type inequalities.

And by the way it includes a nice GLPK wrapper API that integrates well
with numpy.

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

First, install these dependencies:

- python≥3.4
- GLPK (development files)
- setuptools (should be installed by default on many systems)
- cython
- numpy
- scipy
- docopt (use ``pip install docopt`` if unavailable in your package manager)

To build and install pystif, type::

    python setup.py install


Usage
~~~~~

The following subprograms are currently available:

Programs for computing the projection of a convex polyhedron to a subspace:

- ``chm`` — Convex Hull Method
- ``fme`` — Fourier-Motzkin-Elimination
- ``afi`` — Adjacent Facet Iteration
- ``rfd`` — Randomized facet discovery

Peripheral utilities:

- ``equiv`` — check two systems of inequalities for equivalence
- ``makesys`` — create/modify matrix file
- ``pretty`` — human readable display of inequality file
- ``mergesys`` — merge two systems (padding with zeros where needed)
- ``minimize`` — remove redundant inequalities from system

These subprograms are available for execution by their name, e.g.:

.. code-block::

    chm --help

retrieves individual usage information for the ``chm`` utility.

The following typical example computes and prints the marginal entropic
inequalities in a bipartite bell scenario:

.. code-block::

    makesys -v 4 -e -o full.txt
    chm full.txt -o small.txt -l1 -s "AC BC AD BD A B C D"
    pretty small.txt -y "AB <> BA; ABCD <> CDAB"

For more examples, see the ``example/`` subdirectory.


Other components
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are a few more components which I have currently implemented in C++.
I will try to add the most important functionality here — without
sacraficing too much performance if at all possible.


Conventions
~~~~~~~~~~~

Most of the utilities input and output files that represent a linear system
of equations. The files have a simple matrix structure (``numpy.loadtxt``)
and each row corresponds to one inequality ``q∙(1,x) ≥ 0``. The zero-th
column is used as inhomogeneity by letting ``x₀ = 1`` constant. However,
when performing IO on matrices of points (not equations) the zero-th column
should be ignored and may be set to ``0``.

When working with entropy spaces the component ``i`` corresponds to the
joint entropy ``H(I)`` of a subset ``I ⊂ {0, …, N-1}`` where the i-th
variable is in ``I`` iff the i-th bit is non-zero in ``i``, e.g.::

    i   bits    I

    0   000     {        }
    1   001     {X₀      }
    2   010     {   X₁   }
    3   011     {X₀,X₁   }
    4   100     {      X₂}
    5   101     {X₀,   X₂}

The zero-th vector component corresponds to the entropy of the empty set
which is defined to be zero. This matches up nicely with the inhomogeneity
convention explained above.
