pystif
======

Collection of utilities to compute projections of high-dimensional
polytopes into lower dimensional subspaces. In particular this software
focusses on linear cones as generated by Shannon type inequalities.

And by the way in includes a nice GLPK wrapper API that integrates well
with numpy.


Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before you get going you best install these dependencies using your

- python≥3.4
- GLPK
- setuptools (should be installed by default on many systems)
- cython
- numpy
- scipy
- docopt

If *docopt* is not available in your distribution's official repositories,
you can use ``pip`` to install it::

    pip install docopt

pystif can be used locally from its checkout directory, but since it
includes C extensions it needs to be built before it can be used::

    python setup.py build_ext --inplace
    python setup.py build

If you want to install you can just type instead::

    python setup.py install


Usage
~~~~~

The software package is split into many small independent components –
following the well-known UNIX principle.

The following subprograms are currently available as python modules:

- ``pystif.xray`` – find extremal rays of projected cone
- ``pystif.chull`` – compute convex hull given a set of extremal rays
- ``pystif.equiv`` – check two systems of inequalities for equivalence

Type ``python -m pystif.MODULE -h`` to get individual usage information. For
remaining questions, contact me on github or read the source code.
